I wanted something that’s not harmful for my 6 dogs. Mumbies are made of real wood that don’t splinter like you would think wood chews would. They kind of soften as they chew them making them the perfect chews. My Yorkie and malteses are aggressive chewers and these have lasted longer than I thought.

I was very excited when I saw an ad for this coffee wood root toy, seemed like it would be a healthier option than the plastic bones, and maybe last a bit longer than the regular stick chews. We’re a couple weeks in with the root chew and she is constantly gnawing on it and carrying it around with her and she’s hardly made a dent in it.
